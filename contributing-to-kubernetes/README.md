# Contributing to Kubernetes: A Roadmap

Hello :earth_africa:!

Welcome to my roadmap of Kubernetes.
This is purely acollection of useful links and some explanations of the
existing and official
[Kubernetes community documentation](https://github.com/kubernetes/community).

## Organization

Kuberentes has many types of groups and formats, but without a doubt you will
see and hear a lot about Special Interest Groups (SIGs).
Couple things to keep in mind, SIGs focus on an area or problem (i.e., how do
we make Kubernetes easy to operate, how to develop a healthy community, or
networking in Kubernetes), see the full list of
[SIGs and Working Groups](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-list.md).

SIGs usually have multiple subprojects.
For example, two subprojects of SIG cluster lifecycle (a SIG who focuses on
making Kubernetes easy to manage and operate) are
[kubeadm](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubeadm) (a tool for creating
Kubernetes clusters) and
[cluster API](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api) (a project
building a cluster management API or an API).

Please see
[community governance](https://github.com/kubernetes/community#governance)
for full details.

## Finding a Place to Work

If you are interested in contributing to Kubernetes then it is very likely that
you want to join a SIG.
To **join** a SIG, all you have to do is show up :smile:.

There are a couple things you'll have to do to get set up with a SIG:
1. Join their Slack channel. Head over to https://slack.k8s.io to join slack.
2. Join their mailing list. Head over to
  [SIGs and Working Groups](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-list.md)
  look for the SIG you are interested in and look in their contact area for
  their mailing list. Mailing lists are implemented via Google groups. Once you
  join the appropiate Google group you will also get invitations for all of the
  given SIG's meetings.
3. Attend SIG meetings or catch up with their
  [YouTubere cordings](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ2bu0qutTOM0tHYa_jkIwg).

However, this is only half the battle!
In order to find something to work on you will have to be up to date with the
work that is going on, participate in the discussions, do code reviews, triage
existing issues, fix tests (check out https://testgrid.k8s.io/ :heart:).

This is not glamurous work but it is very useful to the community at large.
If you do it for long enough, things will make more sense.
This is the way to become a reviewer and later on an approver, see
[community membership](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/community-membership.md#community-membership)
for more details.
